BetterTimeWarp is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that enables customized time warping.

To install:

1. Merge GameData folder with the one in your KSP folder
2. Done!

Better Time Warp is HappyFaceIndustries' first mod, which adds the ability to customize your time warp.

It has many of the same features as Time Control, and WarpUnlocker, but with a stylish UI and customization features.

Features:

 

Customizable physics and regular (On-Rails) warp
Lower-than-1 physics warp can be used to help with laggy, high part ships. It is also pretty good for cinematics
0x time warp can be used to freeze time
Great for ion engines! 1 hour burn completed in 3 minutes at 20x physical warp.
Higher warp settings can be used in lower orbits
Lossless Physics, meaning that you can keep accurate physics simulation even at high physical time warp. Note that strange things can happen when doing that, and is not recommended, see bugs below
Non-Intrusive UI, which can be disabled using F2
Can be enabled/disabled in the settings file, without uninstalling or deleting
Self regenerating settings file
Persistent time warp selections
Works in space center and tracking station
All planets get the same altitude limits for time warp: 0m for 1-1000, 100,000m for 10,000x, and 2,000,000m for 100,000x
 

Bugs:

Physics warp below x0.1 or above x100 is kind of buggy
Rarely, if using low (less than 0.1) physics warp on EVA, your kerbal will go flying off at about 7x light speed
More will be added to this list as they are found.
